# Jmeter-taurus-local
Run Jmeter in local machine using taurus framework
=======================================================
JMeter is a very popular open source tool for testing your website or webapp. Although it’s quite powerful, it’s not very easy to use and its reporting abilities are very limited. 
Taurus is a free and open source framework for Continuous Testing which helps you by hiding the complexities of running performance tests. 
Think of it as an automation-friendly wrapper - it cloaks nicely around JMeter, neatly covering all of its complexities and imperfections.
When running JMeter through Taurus you can:
•	Run an existing JMeter script
•	Create a new JMeter script very easily using a YAML text file
•	Automate your script with Jenkins/AzureDevops.
